# PRICE SCRAPPER


Yes, CLI applications can be vulnerable to reverse engineering or tampering, especially if they are written in interpreted languages like JavaScript (Node.js). However, there are several strategies you can use to make your CLI more secure and harder to hack. Below are some approaches to package your CLI securely:

---

### **1. Obfuscate the Code**
Obfuscation makes it harder for attackers to understand or modify your code. While it doesn't provide absolute security, it adds a layer of complexity.

#### Tools for Obfuscation:
- **JavaScript Obfuscator**: A popular tool for obfuscating Node.js code.
  ```bash
  npm install javascript-obfuscator
  ```
  Example:
  ```javascript
  const JavaScriptObfuscator = require('javascript-obfuscator');

  const code = `
  function scrapeWebsite(url) {
      console.log('Scraping:', url);
  }
  `;

  const obfuscatedCode = JavaScriptObfuscator.obfuscate(code, {
      compact: true,
      controlFlowFlattening: true,
  }).getObfuscatedCode();

  console.log(obfuscatedCode);
  ```

---

### **2. Package the CLI into a Binary**
Convert your Node.js CLI into a standalone executable. This makes it harder for users to access the source code directly.

#### Tools for Packaging:
- **`pkg`**: Packages Node.js projects into executables.
  ```bash
  npm install pkg
  ```
  Add a `package.json` script:
  ```json
  "scripts": {
      "build": "pkg . --out-path dist"
  }
  ```
  Run:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
  This will generate binaries for Windows, macOS, and Linux in the `dist` folder.

- **`nexe`**: Another tool for creating single executable applications.
  ```bash
  npm install nexe
  ```
  Build:
  ```bash
  npx nexe cli.js -o dist/cli
  ```

---

### **3. Use Environment Variables or Configuration Files for Sensitive Data**
Avoid hardcoding sensitive information (e.g., API keys, credentials) in your code. Instead, use environment variables or external configuration files.

#### Example:
```javascript
const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY || require('./config.json').apiKey;
```

---

### **4. Add License Verification**
Implement a license key system to ensure only authorized users can use your CLI.

#### Steps:
1. **Generate License Keys**:
   Use a library like `crypto` to generate and validate license keys.
   ```javascript
   const crypto = require('crypto');

   function generateLicenseKey() {
       return crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('hex');
   }

   console.log(generateLicenseKey());
   ```

2. **Validate License Keys**:
   Store valid license keys in a secure database or file. Validate the key at runtime.
   ```javascript
   const validKeys = new Set(['abc123', 'def456']);

   function validateLicenseKey(key) {
       return validKeys.has(key);
   }
   ```

3. **Integrate with CLI**:
   Prompt the user for a license key and validate it before allowing access to the scraper.

---

### **5. Use Native Add-ons**
Write performance-critical or sensitive parts of your code in a compiled language like C++ and use Node.js native add-ons. This makes it harder to reverse-engineer.

#### Example:
1. Write a C++ module.
2. Compile it into a `.node` file using `node-gyp`.
3. Use the module in your Node.js code.

---

### **6. Encrypt Sensitive Code**
Encrypt parts of your code and decrypt them at runtime. This adds another layer of protection.

#### Example:
```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

const algorithm = 'aes-256-cbc';
const key = crypto.randomBytes(32);
const iv = crypto.randomBytes(16);

function encrypt(text) {
    let cipher = crypto.createCipheriv(algorithm, Buffer.from(key), iv);
    let encrypted = cipher.update(text);
    encrypted = Buffer.concat([encrypted, cipher.final()]);
    return { iv: iv.toString('hex'), encryptedData: encrypted.toString('hex') };
}

function decrypt(text) {
    let iv = Buffer.from(text.iv, 'hex');
    let encryptedText = Buffer.from(text.encryptedData, 'hex');
    let decipher = crypto.createDecipheriv(algorithm, Buffer.from(key), iv);
    let decrypted = decipher.update(encryptedText);
    decrypted = Buffer.concat([decrypted, decipher.final()]);
    return decrypted.toString();
}

const encrypted = encrypt('Sensitive code here');
console.log(decrypt(encrypted));
```

---

### **7. Use a Licensing Service**
Integrate with a third-party licensing service (e.g., [Keygen](https://keygen.sh/), [Gemini Licensing](https://www.gemini-licensing.com/)) to manage licenses and validate them at runtime.

---

### **8. Distribute via Private Repositories**
Instead of distributing your CLI publicly, host it in a private repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) and provide access only to paying customers.

---

### **9. Add Anti-Tampering Measures**
Detect if the executable has been modified and prevent it from running.

#### Example:
- Compute a hash of the executable at runtime and compare it to a known good hash.
- Use digital signatures to verify the integrity of the executable.

---

### **10. Monitor and Revoke Access**
- Log usage and detect suspicious activity.
- Revoke licenses for unauthorized users.

---

### **Example Secure CLI Workflow**
1. **Obfuscate the code** using `javascript-obfuscator`.
2. **Package the CLI** into a binary using `pkg`.
3. **Add license verification** to validate users.
4. **Encrypt sensitive code** and decrypt it at runtime.
5. **Distribute via a private repository** or a secure download link.

---

### **Final Notes**
While these measures can significantly improve the security of your CLI, no solution is 100% hack-proof. The goal is to make it difficult enough that most attackers won't bother. Focus on providing value to your legitimate users and continuously improve your security measures.
